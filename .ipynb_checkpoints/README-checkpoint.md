Leviathan v0.1 — Housing Affordability Alpha
1. Research Question

Does housing affordability predict future cross-sectional housing returns, conditional on macro regimes?

2. Signal Construction

We construct a composite housing affordability signal using four structural components:

DTI (Debt-to-Income)

PTI (Payment-to-Income)

Rent Burden

Supply Pressure

Each component is standardized cross-sectionally by date and combined into a weighted composite score.

3. Economic Intuition

Housing affordability constraints are largely non-binding during accommodative monetary regimes.
However, during tightening cycles, affordability becomes a binding constraint, amplifying price dispersion across regions.

4. Empirical Results

Positive and statistically meaningful IC in tightening regimes

Weak or insignificant IC during QE regimes

Clear monotonicity in quintile backtests

Signal strength increases post-2022 tightening cycle

5. Conclusion

Affordability is not a universal housing factor.
It is a regime-dependent structural alpha that emerges when credit conditions tighten.

Using a time-series normalization within each metro, the composite affordability signal exhibits a statistically meaningful negative correlation with 12-month forward price appreciation (IC ≈ −0.32 for Austin). This suggests that affordability acts as a slow-moving, pro-cyclical structural variable, consistent with housing market momentum dynamics rather than mean reversion at this horizon.
