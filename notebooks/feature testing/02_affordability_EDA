Affordability Factors – Economic Intuition

DTI (Price / Income)
High → region is expensive relative to income → vulnerability to correction.

PTI (Mortgage Burden)
High → households face monthly payment strain → more macro-sensitive.

Rent Burden
High → rental market tightness + affordability stress.

Supply Pressure
Low inventory + low permits → future supply constrained → supports prices.

Migration Pressure
Strong positive migration increases demand → upward pressure on prices.

//
Conclusion

Austin exhibits (mock data):

High DTI

Positive migration pressure

Tight supply

→ Suggests structural vulnerability if macro conditions deteriorate.
